# Cryptopals (part two)

I had attempted some of the Cryptopals challenges about two years ago and enjoyed them immensely, but as the complexity of the challenges increased I found the libraries I was building spiraling out of control.

So, why not dive back in using my current bread-and-butter language, ES6, and some of the software engineering knowledge I've (hopefully) picked up along the way? I'll be trying to leverage classes and modules in order to make the design as modular and composible as I can.

These problem sets also seem like a good opportunity to use some TDD practices, so I'm going to be writing test frameworks first and then implementing code to satisfy those test cases.
